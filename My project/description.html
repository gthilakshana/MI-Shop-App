            <h1> ABOUT US </h1>
            <P>AliExpress started as a business-to-business buying and selling portal. It has since expanded to include business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer, cloud computing and payment services. As of 2016 AliExpress ran websites in English, Spanish,
                Dutch, French, Italian, German, Polish, Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and Russian languages - English being the default offered to those countries with languages outside the preceding list.[8] AliExpress is often used by e-commerce stores
                that use a dropship business model.[9] Sellers on AliExpress can be either companies or individuals. AliExpress is different from Amazon because it acts only as an e-commerce platform and does not itself sell products directly to consumers.[10]
                It directly connects Chinese businesses with buyers. Although most of the retailers are Chinese, AliExpress is aimed at international import buyers and does not sell to customers in mainland China.[5] Customers in China use fellow Alibaba-subsidiary
                Taobao, because of its convenience in delivery and service, especially the payment method, Alipay. The site offers a popular affiliate marketing program where partners are rewarded with a commission on sales for sending visitors to the
                site
